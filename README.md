# 🛒 Simple Auction (Clarity Smart Contract)

## 📌 Project Title

**Simple Auction** – A Minimal Decentralized Auction System on the Stacks Blockchain

---

## 📄 Project Description

Simple Auction is a smart contract written in **Clarity** for the **Stacks blockchain** that enables a basic, transparent, and trustless auction system. Participants can place bids directly on-chain, and the contract keeps track of the highest bidder and amount without the need for intermediaries.

Currently, the contract implements **two key functions**:

- `place-bid`: Allows users to submit a bid higher than the current highest.
- `get-highest-bid`: Returns the current highest bidder and bid amount.

This minimal version serves as the foundation for a fully-featured decentralized auction dApp.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The vision of Simple Auction is to provide a **fully decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof auction system** that eliminates the need for third-party trust. By leveraging the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, all bids and logic are stored on-chain, ensuring fairness and immutability.
